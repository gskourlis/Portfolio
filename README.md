## Project 1:  Air Quality Data

In this project I analyzed the data and generate insights on air quality trends and correlations, including the average PM2.5 concentration, monthly air quality index (AQI), and the relationship between different pollutants, using Python libraries like pandas,numpy, and matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.

## Project 2:  Fifa Plots Exercise

In this project, I made some interesting plots with real football data provided by Workearly which is the institution I make my "Sports Data Analyst" certification. 

## Project 3:  Percentage of decrement Calculations Whole Circuit

This code was a part of my master's degree thesis. It helped calculate more efficiently the percentage of decrement in sprint performance in footballers when the 6 total sprints were provided as an array. 

## Project 4: Sprint Percentage Calculations Loop

In the same vein as Project 3, this code takes as an input the sprint times in a specific part of a sprint that I wanted to examine, and returns as output the meantime of the pre-test sprints, the percentage of decrement of the actual sprints in function with the trials and the total percentage of decrement of each subject.
