## Project 1:  Air Quality Data

In this project I analyzed the data and generate insights on air quality trends and correlations, including the average PM2.5 concentration, monthly air quality index (AQI), and the relationship between different pollutants, using Python libraries like pandas,numpy, and matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.

## Project 2:  Fifa Plots Exercise

In this project, I made some interesting plots with real football data provided by Workearly which is the institution I make my "Sports Data Analyst" certification. 

## Project 3:  Percentage of decrement Calculations Whole Circuit

This code was a part of my master's degree thesis. It helped calculate more efficiently the percentage of decrement in sprint performance in footballers when the 6 total sprints were provided as an array. 

## Project 4: Sprint Percentage Calculations Loop

In the same vein as Project 3, this code takes as an input the sprint times in a specific part of a sprint that I wanted to examine, and returns as output the meantime of the pre-test sprints, the percentage of decrement of the actual sprints in function with the trials and the total percentage of decrement of each subject.

## Project 5
This is a scatter plot that replicates the correlation between the average speed and accuracy of subjects in a football test which includes sprinting and shooting. The trendline indicates that the higher the speed of a player the higher the accuracy. 

## Project 6 
My 6th project was about extracting data from an SQL database and then making a plot which compared the Average Score vs Age of Football Players.

## Project 7
Utilizing free data from Statsbomb I made a visualisation of the 2022 World Cup Final when Messi made his first pass of the game.

## Project 8
In this project I made a simple barplot about the sucessfull and unsucessfull passes in the Europa League Final between Manchester United and Villareal and 2 maps to see their sucessful passes in the offensive half.

## Project 9 
This is a typical Shot Map from an FC Barcelona match indicating Missed, Saved and Shots in the post.

## Project 10 
The plot I have made declares the xG in function with the xGA of every PL team until today. As seen, the more down and right a team is the better their overall xG/xGA performance and vice versa.
